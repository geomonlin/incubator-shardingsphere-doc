      <description>Test Result Overview  Performance loss test: with sufficient server resources and equal concurrency, the performance loss of Sharding-JDBC, compared to that of JDBC, is lower than 7%. Performance comparison test: with the extreme use of server resources, JDBC and Sharding-JDBC have equal throughput under the same situation. Performance comparison test: with the extreme use of server resources, Sharding-JDBC, after database and table sharding, can have a throughput increase of nearly twice, compared to JDBC without sharding table.</description>
